		\textbf{}Suppose that the reliability of HIV test is specified as follows:\\
		Of people having HIV, $90$\% of the test detect the disease but 10\% go undetected.Of people free of HIV,$99$\% of the test are judged HIV $-$ve but $1$\% are diagnosed as showing HIV $+$ve.From a large population of which only $0.1$\% have HIV,one person is selected at random,given the HIV test and pathologist reports him/her as HIV $+$ve.What is the probability that the person actually has HIV ?\\
	\end{frame}
	\section{Solution}
	\begin{frame}{Solution}
		\textbf{}
		Let $E$ be the event that the person selected is actually having HIV and $A$ be the event that the person's HIV test is diagnosed as $+$ve.We need to find $P(E|A)$ i.e. probability that person is actually having HIV provided he has been diagnose as HIV $+$ve
		\begin{block}{Table}
			\begin{tabular}{|c||l|}
				\hline
				Events & X(random variable)  \\ 
				\hline
				$E$ & $1$ \\ 
				\hline
				$E'$ & $0$ \\ 
				\hline
				$A$ & $1$ \\ 
				\hline
				$A'$ & $0$ \\ 
				\hline
			\end{tabular}
			
		\end{block}
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}
		Also    $E'$ denotes the event that person selected is actually not having HIV.
		\begin{align}
			&P_E(1)=0.1\%=0.1/100=0.001\\
			&P_E(0)=1-P_E(1)=1-0.001=0.999\\
			&P_A(1)=P_E(1)P_A_|_E(1|1)+P_E(1)P_A_|_E(1|0)\\
			&P_A_|_E(1|1)=1\%=0.9\\
			&P_A_|_E(1|0)=90\%=0.01
		\end{align}
		\begin{alertblock}{Approach}
			Using Bayes Theorem
		\end{alertblock}
		
		\begin{align}
			&P_E_|_A(1|1)=P_E_A(1,1)/P_A(1)=\\\nonumber
			&P_E(1)P_A_|_E(1|1)/(P_E(1)P_A_|_E(1|1)+P_E(0)P_A_|_E(1|0)) \\
			&\Rightarrow P_E_|_A(1|1)=0.001\times0.9/(0.001\times0.9+0.999\times0.01)\\
			&\Rightarrow P_E_|_A(1|1)=0.083 
		\end{align}

	\begin{frame}
		\begin{alertblock}{Answer}
			Probability that the person which was reported as HIV $+$ve is actually having the disease$=0.083$
